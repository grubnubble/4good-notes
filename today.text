//--end of day report--\\
    -to give myself some idea of where i left off and what i should be working
    - on next
    
working:
    read the stuff on rubber and capistrano that joe sent via skype
    also go over the commands he sent and know what they mean
    
    ALSO!
    change collected in --> collected into (see if theres a way to change all
        names in sublime)
    
others:
    try to get the remote push to git working for these notes...may be able to
    figure something out at home...idk! my brain is tired.
    
    look up rails routes and resources
        "The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's 
        action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to 
        hardcode strings in your views." --rubyonrails.org
