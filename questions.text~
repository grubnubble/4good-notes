HTML, HAML:

		ol := ordered list
        
which part of the code actually shows the link preview when initially adding the link?
    ans: routes, controller, view each have parts
    routes (link up a route -- one liner)
    controller (define a method)
    view (create a new file -- this is a new view)

is it possible to always have an updated view of link? or is that too costly?

only tentative grasp of routing and how resources works

relationship between page and pageable:
    remember that each of these are just models (think of them as variables)
    page is a way to hold certain attributes for each pageable
    pageables are types of resources: we have 5 now -- events, links, etc
    certain attributes of every pageable is synced with the page table, namely:
        query_path, title, slug, state, created_at, updated_at, published_at, 
        and edited_at (these are in the page model)
