how to get start a conversation about a comment

what are all posts?
    links, resources, events, conversations

using github like redbooth?
	have projects, bugs listed in github instead of redbooth?

is it possible to always have an updated view of link? or is that too costly?

----BUGS?/ETC----

post with title ":(" just routes to the page that lists the user's posts

is there a way to delete multiple posts on the site?
