should we still have the comment button next to the discuss button on conversations?
    it seems redundant. the comment form is already up and ready.

respond and discuss any comment or just latest? because right now we just have 
    these options for the latest.

if it's a conversation, do we want all those tabs in the share modal?

what are all posts?
    links, resources, events, conversations, collections

using github like redbooth?
	have projects, bugs listed in github instead of redbooth?

is it possible to always have an updated view of link? or is that too costly?

----BUGS?/ETC----

edit tags button: put focus on typing area

post with title ":(" just routes to the page that lists the user's posts

is there a way to delete multiple posts on the site?
