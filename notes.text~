project: refresh button for posted links
    purpose: to update links that have been posted 
        (maybe a long time ago...the links themselves may have been updated)
        
know some:
    jQuery -- useful for talking to different browsers (among other things...like finding items)
    javascript
    haml/html
    CSS -- how the HTML/HAML is displayed in the browser

remember:
    check source code for page
    check the js console -- how? and in what context? on the development page?
    different code can take other languages as part of parameters (this is embedding)
    use gitflow

HAML: 
    @<var> is a reference to the file "var"
    
%div{only_for(pageable.editors)}
        = link_to 'Refresh'.html_safe, manage_post_refresh_link_path(:post_id => pageable.id, :post_type => pageable.class.to_s), :remote => true, :disable_with => 'Refreshing...', :class => 'refresh-link-btn btn btn-mini'
