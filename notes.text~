project: change the leads thing to just 3 check boxes:
            start a conversation
            like this resource
            follow <user>
       
    have a before filter to make sure the user is signed in (use
      def authenticate_user! in application_controller.rb as the filter)
    the start a conversation checkbox will do exactly what the "Connect with
      <user>" button on the side does

only push the changes we're keeping: ie
    leads_controller
    _request_lead
    create
    new
    
    actually, joe says to do a global search on lead and rm all those files
    
play with the conversation thing user/visitor

have request_lead be called when a link is clicked (joe said he'd probably do this)
