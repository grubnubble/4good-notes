    "Watched By"
    "This Page Is Part Of These Collections"?

need to replace @page, @page.id with an array of all uids that like the page
    right now it just shows itself.
    in other words, how do we retrieve the list of all uids that like the 
        current page?
        something to do with querying the database
    also check to see if we need the likedby_uids_map

example to study:
    the horizontal scroll for "Others Are Also Interested In"
    trace this 
        
know some:

review polymorphic and write notes on what it means

haml:
