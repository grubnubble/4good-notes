project: refresh button for posted links
    purpose: to update links that have been posted 
        (maybe a long time ago...the links themselves may have been updated)
        
know some:
    jQuery -- useful for talking to different browsers (among other things...like finding items)
    javascript
    haml/html
    CSS -- how the HTML/HAML is displayed in the browser

remember:
    check source code for page
    check the js console -- how? and in what context? on the development page?
    different code can take other languages as part of parameters (this is embedding)
    use gitflow
    
routes (link up a route -- one liner)
controller (define a method)
view (create a new file -- this is a new view)

HAML: 
    @<var> is a reference to the file "var"
