----PROJECT WORKING----
use the video/mp4 support as an example

in assetworker under video version:
when *Asset::AUDIO_MIMES then
        client = AWS::ElasticTranscoder::Client.new
        response = client.create_job :pipeline_id => CONFIG[:cloud_providers][:aws][:elastic_transcoder][:pipeline_id],
          :input => {
            :key => asset.payload_uid,
            :interlaced => 'auto',
            :container => 'auto'
          },
          :output => {
            :key => "#{asset.payload_uid}.mp3",
            :preset_id => CONFIG[:cloud_providers][:aws][:elastic_transcoder][:preset_id],
          }
        asset.uid = response[:job][:id]
        asset.processing!
        AssetWorker.perform_in 3.seconds, asset_id, index + 1
      else
        asset.processed!
      end

----OTHER WORKING----

review polymorphic and write notes on what it means

----OLD NOTES----

relationship between page and pageable:
    remember that each of these are just models (think of them as variables)
    page is a way to hold certain attributes for each pageable
    pageables are types of resources: we have 5 now -- events, links, etc
    certain attributes of every pageable is synced with the page table, namely:
        query_path, title, slug, state, created_at, updated_at, published_at, 
        and edited_at (these are in the page model)

"The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's 
        action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to 
        hardcode strings in your views." --rubyonrails.org
