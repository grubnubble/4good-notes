tracing the conversationable:
    the goal with this trace is to show how each file connects to the next on a
    low level. details for naming conventions and accessing variables should 
    then be easier to replicate in the future (ie: look at this trace to see 
    what name to call/how to access what you need)

this is quite complicated, because not all posts have a conversationable.

but

here goes.

so discuss gets clicked --> posts_controller --> discuss.js ->share_modal->
    posts_controller create method (not sure how we get here...input?)

share_modal: #conversationable is a div id

when a conversation is created, the attributes conversationable_id and 
    conversationable_type are instantiated with the id of the parent post and the
    class of the parent post.
    so, if the user is creating a conversation from resource0 (say this post
    has id 0 and class resource), then the conversation (call it convers0) has 
    conversationable_id = 0 and conversationable_type = resource.
    
when the conversation is created, the posts_controller (rb) sets up a 
    @conversationable instance variable of type conversationable_type and id 
    conversationable_id in discuss.js
    
then share_modal *somehow* gets a post created --> posts_controller again

now in the create method of post_controller, we make a new instance variable
    called @post
    and then set up another instance variable @post.conversationable with id
    and type the same as conversationable_id, conversationable_type respectively
    (this is the same as in discuss)
    the @post.publish! line replaces @post with the result of @post.publish
    publish method comes from where?
    
ok, that's not as thorough as i'd like, but it gives a pretty good representation
    of my understanding as of now
