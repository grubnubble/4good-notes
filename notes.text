project: building mentions and references models and relationships (in the database)
            each of these need a model
            there are essentially the same things, but mentions are for users and
            organizations, whereas refs are for all the other things.
            these will replace responses. there will still be a link on comments
            like the one there now for respond, but it will just autofill the 
            mention or ref boxes.
            responses depend on parent comment relationship
            these models will need double polymorphic relationships with 
                for eg mentionables and mentioners; referenceable and referencers

ok, not sure if the text = self.body
                    text = self.description
                    will work. but it's worth a host, no?

issue with link: has to do with the reference id being changed. now the resource
    that points to it doesnt have the reference pointing back

in rails console, to get a new mention:
    $m = Mention.new
    $m.mentioner_id = Resource.first.id (for eg)
    $m.mentioner_type = 'Resource'
    
    then connect the other way:
    $Resource.first.mentions << m
    
    similarly for reference
    
work in console: try calling sync_mentions and sync_references
    figure out what's going on in a resource first (before you mess with comments)
    
    
def sync_references
      if self.class.name == 'Comment'
        text = @body
        changed = body_changed?
      else
        text = @description
        changed = description_changed?
      end

      if text and changed
        text.scan(/(^|\A|\s|\>)\:([a-z\d-]+)\/([a-z\d-]+)($|\z|\s|\<)/) { |match|
          if page = Page.where(:query_path => $2, :slug => $3).first
            unless referenceables.exists? :referenceable_id => page.pageable_id, :referenceable_type => page.pageable_type
              referenceables.create :referenceable => page.pageable
            end
          end
        }
        referenceables.each do |reference|
          unless text.include? ':' + reference.referenceable.page.query_path + '/' + reference.referenceable.page.slug
            reference.destroy
          end
        end
      end
    end
    
solution:   added models for Reference and Mention with polymorphic associations
                mentions and mentionables
            indexed these relationships uniquely (in a migration)
            in mentionables and referenceables, added sync_mentions and
                sync_references, respectively
            included Mentionable and Referenceable in pageable and comment

----OTHER WORKING----

check out collaborators when you use the +share button at the upper right corner
    it seems buggy

for making things look nice, maybe we could have an if statement in description that
    gives the first few lines of the comment...you can call description on a pageable
    for sure, but can we call it on a comment?
    also, get the conversations slider for comments smaller than the one for 
        collected_into and also use smaller, square tiles
        maybe even just have an ajax-openable slider for conversations (if you 
            want to see the conversations this comment has spawned, click and it
            will appear. otherwise just a clickable thing like "see conversations
            about this comment"

in pageable, change the collections and collectionable lines (just 2 lines)
    into concerns (like conversationable)

have a before filter to make sure the user is signed in (use
    def authenticate_user! in application_controller.rb as the filter)
want the authenticate_user! method to hide all other modals when it pops up
    
have request_lead be called when a link is clicked (joe said he'd probably do this)
    so that when the user is done looking at the linked-to site, and returns to 
    our site, they will get the request_lead modal pop up

----OLD NOTES----

:touch => true in a polymorphic association (in a model) sets the updated_at or 
    updated_on timestamp to the current time when the object is saved or destroyed.
    so you'll want this true on things that can be added to other objects by
    users, such as mentions, references, comments, etc

posts are: Resource, Link, Collection, Conversation, Event
    (from page model :scope near the top of the file)
    
helpers are for views -- to keep views clean if you have a lot of complicated
    ruby that you don't want to put into erb and just need to access some methods

relationship between page and pageable:
    remember that each of these are just models (think of them as variables)
    page is a way to hold certain attributes for each pageable
    pageables are types of resources: we have 5 now -- events, links, etc
    certain attributes of every pageable is synced with the page table, namely:
        query_path, title, slug, state, created_at, updated_at, published_at, 
        and edited_at (these are in the page model)

"The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's 
        action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to 
        hardcode strings in your views." --rubyonrails.org

MVC, asset relationship
	MVCs use assets (assets are javascripts, images, CSS)
