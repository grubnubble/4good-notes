    -how to manage commits with branches and git flow
    
To start a new feature/project:
    Beginning on *develop*
    $git flow feature start name_of_branch

Then go to notes.text and describe the project under "project"
    include any relevant notes
    
At the end of the day, add where you left off in today.text under "working"
    it's probably a good idea to commit this, too, with a description of the 
    work you did
    
When the project is finished:
    in notes.text, write:
    solution: followed by a description of how you fixed the problem or added
        the feature or whatever. put this between project: and ----OTHER WORKING----
    commit this:
    $git commit -am "Adds solution and last notes"
    
    then delete solution:, everything under project:, and everything under
        working: in today.text.
    commit this:
    $git commit -am "Cleans up notes and today for merge and finish"
    push these commits to the remote repo:
    $git push origin feature/name_of_branch
    finish the branch with git flow:
    $git flow feature finish name_of_branch
    
and you will be put back onto develop!
