//--end of day report--\\
    -to give myself some idea of where i left off and what i should be working
    - on next
    
working:
    try to get the refresh button for a link working. still need to figure out 
    how to render it on the page -- see questions.text for details
    
    try looking at pages/_link.html.haml
    
others:
    try to get the remote push to git working for these notes...may be able to
    figure something out at home...idk! my brain is tired.
    
    look up rails routes and resources
        "The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's 
        action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to 
        hardcode strings in your views." --rubyonrails.org
    
    figure out how to, in sublime, search for lines of code in a project
        (not just the titles)
        ans: ctl+shift+f searches all of the project
             ctl+f searches current file
