//--end of day report--\\
    -to give myself some idea of where i left off and what i should be working
    - on next. End of day only!

working:
well. today was weird.

im a little overwhelmed by where i am now. i thought i knew what i was doing 
    and it turns out that i did not know at all what i was doing. 
    
the error on the screen when you try to delete a conversation...i dont know 
    what it is from. joe and i tried to get to the bottom of this. will come
    back to it.
    
ask joe about testing through the console only

two loops to check the body for refs and mentions: you are scanning for mentions
    checking against the db. use the redcarpet code for this.
    (if mention exists in db && in body
        do nothing)
    if mention in db && !in body
        delete from db
    if mention !in db && in body
        add to db

----OTHER WORKING----

try connect with user > cancel 
    then click discuss to see if user shows up as collaborator.
    fix one way or another (either have user always or never)
    better to have owner added as collaborator initially.

there is a $0.00 that drops down and then slides back up when the modal first 
    appears (this is on the live site, too; you just notice it because dev is
    slower)

try to get the remote push to git working for these notes...
    the remote repository was created, but the set up is still wonky
    config it better or something. it's set up through URL. better by SSH.
    also figure out how to create remote branches and save that cmnd in
    usefulcmds_ansquestions.text
    
rambaldi git: the remote feature/audio_support branch is gone, but it still shows
    up when i run $git branch -a
