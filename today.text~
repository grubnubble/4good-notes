//--end of day report--\\
    -to give myself some idea of where i left off and what i should be working
    - on next
    
working:
    make a new partial modeled after _tile.html.haml called 
        _tile_user_organization.html.haml that makes tiles into a grid layout
    change the _tile.css file so that the grid can only be so big before you scroll
    
    
others:
    try to get the remote push to git working for these notes...may be able to
    figure something out at home...idk! my brain is tired.
    
    look up rails routes and resources
        "The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's 
        action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to 
        hardcode strings in your views." --rubyonrails.org
    
    take out triple lines in _liked_by.html.haml
    
    remember to update watched_by as you have liked_by
