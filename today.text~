//--end of day report--\\
    -to give myself some idea of where i left off and what i should be working
    - on next. End of day only!

working:
once we get the conversationable.html.haml working for comments, we can finish
    the take_off_comments branch of git
    
next time, this is priority along with discuss.js.erb comment handling, then 
    styling on conversationable.html.haml (but switch to in_reference_to_box branch
    for that last one)
    
try connect with user > cancel 
    then click discuss to see if user shows up as collaborator.
    fix one way or another (either have user always or never)
    better to have owner added as collaborator initially.

there is a $0.00 that drops down and then slides back up when the modal first 
    appears (this is on the live site, too; you just notice it because dev is
    slower)
    
it's probably time to look at _share_modal.html.haml

----OTHER WORKING----
try to get the remote push to git working for these notes...may be able to
    figure something out at home...idk! my brain is tired.
