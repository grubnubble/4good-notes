//--end of day report--\\
    -to give myself some idea of where i left off and what i should be working
    - on next. End of day only!

working:
the error on the current dev page that's up is popping up because we need
    conversation.pageable (or page?) something like that. look at the code joe
    changed earlier today (maybe discuss.js.erb? or the share_modal.html.haml?)

try connect with user > cancel 
    then click discuss to see if user shows up as collaborator.
    fix one way or another (either have user always or never)
    better to have owner added as collaborator initially.

there is a $0.00 that drops down and then slides back up when the modal first 
    appears (this is on the live site, too; you just notice it because dev is
    slower)

----OTHER WORKING----
try to get the remote push to git working for these notes...
    the remote repository was created, but the set up is still wonky
    config it better or something. it's set up through URL. better by SSH.
    also figure out how to create remote branches and save that cmnd in
    usefulcmds_ansquestions.text
    
rambaldi git: the remote feature/audio_support branch is gone, but it still shows
    up when i run $git branch -a
